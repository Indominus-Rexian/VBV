# VBV
A very basic virus, made with tkinter
-----------
(Only supports Windows now, but made in Linux)
This Virus was created using [Python](https://www.python.org/) library [Tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/).
This virus is basically harmless.
It doesn't let you close the window so easily(without killing the terminal) and just clicking a button can create a window, you can create as many windows as you like by clicking it.

## How I Changed .py to .exe

Well there were many ways to do so, But I used this [library](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) which made it so easy to change it.
A tutorial for the same can be found [here](https://datatofish.com/executable-pyinstaller/).

I guess I will continue to make more normal viruses(or scripts ;-;) like this in the future while learning GUI Python.

## Source Code

To get the source code, you can download the app.py from [above](https://github.com/Indominus-Rexian/VBV/blob/main/app.py)

## .EXE

You can download the .EXE from the [releases pane](https://github.com/Indominus-Rexian/VBV/releases/tag/alpha) or directly [here](https://github.com/Indominus-Rexian/VBV/releases/download/alpha/vbv-v1.0.zip).
Just extract the compressesd file and you will find the .exe file named as Indo.exe(I will change the from next time :/)
